# Rigid Body Dynamics

This chapter covers the fundamentals of rigid body dynamics as they apply to bipedal walking.

## Newton-Euler Equations

The motion of a rigid body is governed by Newton's second law for translation and Euler's equation for rotation.

For translational motion:

$$
F = ma
$$

where $F$ is the net force, $m$ is the mass, and $a$ is the acceleration.

For rotational motion about the center of mass:

$$
\tau = I\alpha
$$

where $\tau$ is the net torque, $I$ is the moment of inertia, and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration.

## Equations of Motion

The general equation of motion for a rigid body system can be written as:

$$
M(q)\ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q})\dot{q} + g(q) = \tau
$$

<MathBlock tex="M(q)\ddot{q} + C(q, \dot{q})\dot{q} + g(q) = \tau" />

## Example: Simple Pendulum

A simple pendulum demonstrates the basic principles:

<CodeEditor
  initialCode={`import math

# Simple pendulum parameters
g = 9.81  # gravity (m/s^2)
L = 1.0   # length (m)
theta0 = math.pi / 6  # initial angle (30 degrees)

# Natural frequency
omega_n = math.sqrt(g / L)
period = 2 * math.pi / omega_n

print(f"Natural frequency: {omega_n:.3f} rad/s")
print(f"Period: {period:.3f} s")
`}
/>
